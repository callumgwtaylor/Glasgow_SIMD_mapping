# Glasgow_SIMD_mapping
Combining existing data sets to recreate Glasgow Index of Multiple Deprivation mapping

This is not original work, and I don't pretend that it is.

Glasgow and the Scottish Government has some great open access data available online, and I wanted to use some in a project at work.

I wanted to look at the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation for Glasgow City, and use R to look at it further.

Using preexisting datasets, and preexisting guides, I've combined the data sets, making it easier to plot maps of the information.

I've uploaded it to spare other people the effort.

The data sets I've used are:

https://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset/output-areas
https://www.freemaptools.com/download-uk-postcode-lat-lng.htm

The guides I've used are mainly:

There were a couple of other blog posts that I found really useful at the time and can't find again now (a few weeks after first doing this), if you see (or if you wrote!) something that I was clearly using please let me know and I'll add it to the list. Again, not trying to pretend this is any original work, just wanted to save others the effort.
